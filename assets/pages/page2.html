         On a related note, some of the backlash from my blog was due to an accusation that speaking out was a ploy to further my "cosplay or modeling career." I can't prevent this line of thinking from individuals who judge my worth exclusively upon a photo they pick that speaks to their agenda. In reality however, I have a personal policy against monetizing my cosplay endeavors, or imparting a competitive component to my hobby. Selling photos or charging for appearances could help recoup some of the massive costs associated with constructing costumes, but I fear that incentivizing cosplay with money could detract from the real reason I do what I do. I don't take any issue with those who make money from their passion projects, but it's not an approach I personally take.
